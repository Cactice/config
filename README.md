# config
I'll keep track of my config files etc for when I wipe my data.

# How to use
## Shell Scripts
Just execute these to install whatever

## Config files
Config files should be hard linked to the desired path of the software referencing it.  
Use `ln` to link to config files if not done in the shell scripts.
